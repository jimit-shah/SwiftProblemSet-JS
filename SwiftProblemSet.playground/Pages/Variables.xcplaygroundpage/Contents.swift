 ### Exercise 1
 
 For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - gallonsRemainingInTank (`Double`)
 - ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (`Int`)
 - birthplace (`String`)
 - myFirstProgrammingLanguage (`String`)
 */
// Solution
var gallonsRemainingInTank: Double
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: Int
let birthplace: String = "Chicago"
let myFirstProgrammingLanguage = "Java"

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Make the minimal changes necessary to fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants.
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
gallonsRemainingInTank = 2
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let bestProgrammingLanguage: String = myFirstProgrammingLanguage


//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared `stringToReverse` and `arrayOfCharacters` as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with `let`, no variables. **Note**: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.
var stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
var arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.characters.reversed()
stringToReverse = String(arrayOfCharacters)

// Solution
let constStringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
let arrayOfReversedCharacters = constStringToReverse.characters.reversed()
let finalReversedString = String(arrayOfReversedCharacters)
/*: 
### Exercise 4

 For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

- an `Int` value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
- an `Int` value representing the score always required to win a game.
- a `String` value representing a studentâ€™s birthday.
- a `String` value representing what a user types into the status update area.
*/
// Solution
var hungerLevelOfAnimal: Int
let minScoreToWinGame: Int
let studentBirthday: String
var userInputStatusUpdate: String

//optional to assign value when declaring a constant, as you can assign it letter like this:
minScoreToWinGame = 51
print(minScoreToWinGame)
